# Interface
You can interact with other contracts by declaring an Interface.

- Interface can not have any function with implementation.
- Interface can not inherit from other contracts, but they can inherit from other interfaces.
- Functions of an interface can be only of type external.
- Interface can not have constructor.
- Interface can not have state variables.
- Interface can have enum, structs which can be accessed using interface name dot notation.
For example a contract that uses the sample interface below can access Iauto.carType and Iauto.vehicle.

```jsx

pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

interface Iauto {
    enum carType { gas, electric}
    struct vehicle { string car; string truck; }
    function transfer(address recipient, uint amount) external;
}
```
