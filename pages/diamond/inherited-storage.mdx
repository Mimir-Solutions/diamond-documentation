# Inherited Storage

A proxy contract and its facets inherit a storage contract that contains the storage variables that they use. This ensures that the proxy contract and its facets all declare the same state variables in the same order so there is no conflict.

## Downsides
1. Facets need to inherit storage contracts that may contain many state variables that they donâ€™t use.

2. Facets become tightly coupled to specific proxy contracts and facets and cannot be used by other proxy contracts and facets that declare different state variables.
