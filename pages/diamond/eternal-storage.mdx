# Eternal Storage
Using Solidity mappings to create an API for contract storage. A proxy contract and facets can use the same Eternal Storage API to create and use whatever storage variables are needed without conflict.

## Downsides
1. The state variable syntax and organization of Eternal Storage is clumsy. It is full of `getInt`, `setInt`, `getString`, `setString` type of functions.

2. It works directly for simple values and arrays but it does not work in a simple, generic way for mappings and structs.

3. A proxy contract and all of its facets must use the same storage API.

4. Not easy to see at a glance what state variables exist because they are not declared together anywhere
