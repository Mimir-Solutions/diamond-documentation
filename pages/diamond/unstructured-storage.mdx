# Unstructured Storage
Solidityâ€™s storage layout can be bypassed with assembly allowing a programmer to set and store values at arbitrary positions in contract storage. This is the Unstructured Storage pattern.

## Downsides
1. A getter and setter function needs to be defined and used for each storage variable.

2. This works for simple values. It does not work for structs or mappings.
