# Diamond Storage

Here is the Diamond Storage pattern:

Create a contract. This is a Diamond Storage contract but let’s call it “storage contract” because that is shorter.
Create a struct in the storage contract that contains the state variables you care about.
Choose a position in storage to read and write your struct.
Write a function in the storage contract that creates a storage pointer for the struct and returns it.
Any contract/proxy/facet that needs to read/write the state variables defined in the storage contract just needs to inherit the storage contract and call the function that returns the storage pointer.
Here is a simple, made up example of a contract that uses Diamond Storage:

```jsx
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

contract MyStorageContract {
// The state variables we care about.
  struct MyStorage {
    uint aVar;
    bytes myBytes;
    mapping(uint => bytes32) myMap;
  } 
  // Creates and returns the storage pointer to the struct.
  function myStorage() internal pure returns(MyStorage storage ms) {
    // ms_slot = keccak256("com.mycompany.my.storage")
    assembly {ms_slot := 0xabcd55b489adb030b...d09c4154cf0}
  }
}
```

If you want to see a real example check out the reference implementation of the diamond standard which was recently updated to use Diamond Storage. Specifically look at LibDiamond.sol.

Here is an example of code that uses the above MyStorageContract:

```jsx
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

contract MyContract is MyStorageContract {
 function doSomething(uint selector, bytes32 myData) external {
   MyStorage storage ms = myStorage();
   ms.myMap[selector] = myData;
   ms.aVar = uint(myData);
   //... more code;
 }
 
function returnMyData(uint selector) external view returns(bytes32){
   MyStorage storage ms = myStorage();
   bytes32 data = ms.myMap[selector];
   //... more code
   return data;
 }
}
```
