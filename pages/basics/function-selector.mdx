# Function Selector
- When a function is called, the first 4 bytes of calldata specifies which function to call.
- It is the first (left, high-order in big-endian) four bytes of the Keccak-256 hash of the signature of the function.
- The function name with the parenthesised list of parameter types. Parameter types are split by a single comma, no spaces are used.

A call to the function `f` with parameters `a_1, ..., a_n` is encoded as

```jsx
function_selector(f) enc((a_1, ..., a_n))
```
and return values `v_1, ..., v_k` of `f` are encoded as
```jsx
enc((v_1, ..., v_k))
```

# Example1

```jsx
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

contract Foo {
  function bar(bytes3[2]) public pure {}
  function baz(uint32 x, bool y) public pure returns (bool r) { r = x > 32 || y; }
  function sam(bytes, bool, uint[]) public pure {}
}
```
Calling `baz` with the parameters `69` and `true`. we would pass 68 bytes total.
```jsx
0xcdcd77c000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000450000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001
```
which can be broken down into:
- The method ID: `0xcdcd77c0`. This is derived as the first 4 bytes of the Keccak hash of the ASCII form of the signature `baz(uint32,bool)`
```jsx
bytes4(keccak256(bytes("baz(uint32,bool)")))
```
- The first parameter, a `uint32` value `69` padded to 32 bytes
```jsx
0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000045
```
- The second parameter - boolean `true`, padded to 32 bytes

```jsx
0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001
```

## Examples
- The method ID or function selector of `transfer(address,uint256)` is `0xa9059cbb`.
- The method ID or function selector of `transferFrom(address,address,uint256)` is `0x23b872dd`.
- The method ID or function selector of `totalSupply()` is `0x18160ddd`.
- The method ID or function selector of `balanceOf(address)` is `0x70a08231`.
